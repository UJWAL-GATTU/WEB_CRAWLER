# WEB_CRAWLER

A **web crawler** is a program or script that automatically surfs the Web to index information of the visited pages for a search engine. It's also referred to as a **Web Spider** or **Web Robot**. Web crawlers are used by search engines, such as Google or Bing, to collect data from websites for indexing in their database. This way, they'll have the content that will enable them to respond to users whenever a user makes an inquiry with appropriate search results.

### How Web Crawlers Work:
1. **Starting Point:** Web crawlers typically start from a list that has been previously curated; this is also referred to as seeds. They access these URLs and download the content of the pages.

2. **Parsing and Indexing:** The crawler will read the page's content. Extracting all data, which includes text, links, metadata, etc., it indexes this information to help the search engine understand what the page is about.

3. **Following Links**: When visiting a page, a crawler identifies the hyperlinks on the page and adds them to the list of URLs it has to visit, thus being able to move from one page to another and "crawl" the web.

4. **Handling Rules:** Web crawlers follow a set of rules provided by the websites, generally in `robots.txt` file. The file informs the crawler of the pages or areas of the site that it should not access and index.

5. **Recurrence:** Crawlers periodically revisit sites for changes in content or new information, hence keeping the search engine's index up to date.

### Applications of Web Crawlers:
- **Search Engines:** Web crawlers mainly find their application in search engines, whose job is to index the web for providing relevant results to the user with regard to his search.
- **Data Mining:** Crawlers can also be used to collect large datasets from websites. They can be used for analysis for research, business intelligence, and other such applications.
- **Content Aggregation:** Other websites may use crawlers to collect content from various sources to provide a single unified view, such as news aggregators.
- **Monitoring:** Crawlers can be used to monitor websites for changes, like tracking price changes or checking whether the content has been updated.

Web crawlers are an intrinsic part of how the internet functions, particularly regarding how information gets organized and accessed.
